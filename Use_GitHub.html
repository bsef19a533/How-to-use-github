    <h1>A step-by-step guide to Github</h1><br>
    <h2>Step 1: Create a Github account</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to get started is to create an account on GitHub.com</p><br>
    <img src="git_guide1.png" alt="xyz"><br>
    <p>Pick a username, enter your email address and a password, and click Sign up for GitHub.<br>
    Once you are in, it will look something like this:</p><br>

    <h2>Step 2: Create a new repository</h2>
    <p>
        Repositories are storage containers for a project where you can save different versions <br>
        of your code To create a new repository, select New Repository from the + sign dropdown <br>
        menu (you can see I've selected it in the upper-right corner in the image above).
   </p><br>

   <p>Enter a name for your repository(e.g, "Demo") and click Create Repository. Don't worry about changing <br>any other options on this page.</p><br>

   <h2>Step 3: Install Git</h2>
   <p>To see if you already have Git installed, open up your terminal application.<br><br>
    If you're on a Windows machine, open the windows command prompt or "Git Bash".<br><br>
    Once you've opened your terminal application, type git version. The output will either tell you<br>
    which version of Git is installed, or it will alert you that git is an unknown command. If it's an<br>
    unknown command, then install Git.
   </p>
   <h3>Install Git for windows</h3>
   <p>1. Navigate to the latest Git for Windows installer and download the latest version.<br>
    2. Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until the installation is complete.<br>
    3. Open the windows command prompt (or Git Bash if you selected not to use the standard Git Windows Command Prompt during the Git installation).<br>
    4. Type git version to verify Git was installed.<br><br>
    Note: git-scm is a popular and recommended resource for downloading Git for Windows. The advantage <br>
    of downloading Git from git-scm is that your download automatically starts with the latest version <br>
    of Git included with the recommended command prompt, Git Bash . <br>
</p>
<h2>Step 4: Clone your Repository</h2>
<p>Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically<br>
makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer..To clone repo, copy the address of repository
</p>

<p>Open git bash, Go to the current directory where you want the cloned directory to be added.<br><br>
Use "git clone" command and paste the address copied as shown below:</p>

<h2>Step 5: Create a file</h2>

<h2>Step 5: Add the file</h2>
<p>The "<b>git add</b>" command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file<br>
in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.<br><br>
<b>git add 'yourFileName'</b>
</p>

<h2>Step 6: Commit the file</h2>
<p>
    The "<b>git commit</b>" command will save all staged changes, along with a brief description from the user.<br>
    In "commit message" , you can enter anything that describes the changes you are committing.<br><br>
    <b>git commit -m "commit message"</b>
</p>

<h2>Step 7: Git Status</h2>
    <p>
        The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't,<br>
        and which files aren't being tracked by Git.<br><br>
        <b>git status</b>
    </p>

<h2>Step 8: Git Push</h2>
<p>
    After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.<br><br>
    <b>git push</b>
</p>

<h2>Step 9: Git Pull</h2>
<p>
    The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote<br>
     upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.<br><br>
     <b>git pull</b>
